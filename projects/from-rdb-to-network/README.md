## 🔄 Overview: From RDB to Network

**From RDB to Network** is an experimental project that transforms relational data into network graphs using Python (pandas + NetworkX).

Disparate CSVs and SQL tables are reconnected through the lens of **relationships**,
reconstructing data into a **web of interconnected meaning**.
The transformation process itself becomes a story — a shift from static records to living systems.

---

## 🧪 Current Prototypes

Within the CANW ecosystem, we are developing use-case prototypes such as:

* [🍄 **Fungi Network**](./fungi-network)

  * Modeling fungal hyphal structures from CSV data and visualizing their network dynamics

* [ ⚩ **Shrine Network**](./shrine-network)

  * Mapping shrines worshiping the same deity and visualizing their geographic and relational networks

* [ 🐜 **Soil Fauna Network**](./soil-fauna-network)

  * Representing co-occurrence and predator-prey relations among soil organisms as ecological graphs

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack & OSS Approach

Currently, the pipeline is built using Python (pandas + NetworkX), with the following principles:

* Entities and relationships are defined in CSV format
* Node attributes and labeled edges enrich semantic context
* Layout emphasizes **spatial structures**, not random positioning

**What is data?**
Let’s rethink its potential — from rigid structures to living networks.
