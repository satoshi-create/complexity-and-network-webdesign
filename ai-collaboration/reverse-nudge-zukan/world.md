# 🌏 world\_en.md｜Worldbuilding and Structural Lens

## Introduction

This document outlines the narrative setting and structural lens of the `reverse-nudge-zukan` project. Rather than merely a backdrop, the world functions as a symbolic operating system where **institutional inertia, emotional tension, and UX dysfunction** collide.

Characters, storylines, and diagrams are all rooted in this shared meta-structure.

## 1. Setting: Institutional Terrain and UX Labyrinths

* The world takes place in contemporary and near-future Japan.
* It focuses on **public-facing UX spaces**: city halls, hospitals, schools, job-hunting platforms, smartphone apps, etc.
* These spaces are plagued by deeply embedded friction—structural flaws, outdated norms, excessive paperwork, and hyper-polite language rituals.
* Settings include metaphorical locations like "Yumeshima (Expo Island)," "Kasumigaseki Underground," and the "Web Form Labyrinth."

## 2. Structural Critique: Three Axes of Analysis

### 🔹 Institutional Structure

* Institutions are not fixed rules but historical and cultural "OS layers."
* Examples: Paper dominance, procedural supremacy, PDF dependency, honorific language UX, MyNumber bureaucracy

### 🔹 Emotional Layer

* Institutions often pretend to be caring, but beneath lie pressures to conform, emotional labor, and institutionalized need for approval.
* Example: Setsuko-tan’s anxiety about being called by number; Sentobou’s passive, healing neutrality

### 🔹 Technical Interface

* Many UIs begin as rational systems but become hostile through misalignment with institutional demands.
* Examples: Form validation hell, print errors, VBA dungeons, non-editable PDFs

## 3. A Structural Ecosystem of Characters

* Characters emerge naturally from structural bugs and institutional behaviors.
* The world’s balance is sustained by the structural back-and-forth between Gojuemon (kaiju of critique) and Myakumyake (monster of ambivalence).
* Characters interact with users by embodying confusion, resistance, or surrender.

## 4. The Role of Worldbuilding in the Project

* Grounds the short stories in `narrative/`
* Defines profiles and backstories in `zukan/`
* Enables coherent development for education, critique, ZINEs, and AI collaboration

---

## 5. Future Expansions: Maps, Timelines, Structural Trees

* This world can be extended through:

  * Mermaid-based structural evolution trees
  * UX monster emergence timelines
  * Metaphorical maps of key settings (Kasumigaseki Underground, Web Form Labyrinth, etc.)

## Closing Note

`world_en.md` serves as the operating system file of this satire-critique-creation loop.
Let’s laugh, critique, and create—together with our monsters and misalignments.
