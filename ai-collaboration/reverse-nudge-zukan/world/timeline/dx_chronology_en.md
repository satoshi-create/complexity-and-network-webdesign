# 📜 Galapagos Reverse-Nudge DX Chronology

This timeline documents the unique trajectory of Japan's "DX" (Digital Transformation) not as a global trend, but as a culturally mutated, institutionally embedded phenomenon—personified as the divine entity "De-ekkusu-sama." From the era of kana-typewriters to the age of cloud-AI confusion, this satirical chronology traces the emergence of reverse-nudge UX monsters born from bureaucracy, design inertia, and social complexity.
