## 🎯 Project Overview

`reverse-nudge-zukan` is an OSS project that identifies and critiques "reverse-nudge UX" in Japanese society—designs that make systems harder to use, often unintentionally. By creating humorous characters and dramatized scripts, we reveal the structural flaws behind seemingly mundane interfaces.

This is a submodule of the CANW (Complexity and Network Webdesign) initiative, which embraces the expression of complexity without simplification.
