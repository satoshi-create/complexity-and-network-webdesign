## 🐽 Project Overview

Jomon Fiction is envisioned as a subproject of [CANW: Complexity and Network Webdesign](https://github.com/satoshi-create/complexity-and-network-webdesign/tree/main).  
Each short story is based on hub settlements (e.g., Tadao, Aku, Shimonoya sites), and draws on a multilayered structure of narrative, terrain, and network.

This project is built on layered components:

- `story-layer`: Narrative drafts, characters, and episode design
- `research-layer`: Archaeological, geographic, and mythological research
- `code-layer`: Network visualization and geospatial modeling (Python / GeoJSON)
- `publication-layer`: Structured publication of AI images, prompts, and bilingual commentary
