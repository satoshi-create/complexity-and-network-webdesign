## 🔄 Overview: AI Collaboration

**AI Collaboration** is a collaborative project that leverages generative AI and automation tools to weave creative networks in storytelling, culture, and science.
AI responds to human insights and questions,
and recursively weaves together the layers of **prototypes, stories, dialogues, and visualization** —
this collaborative process itself is the “story” of this project.

---

## 🧪 Ongoing Sub-Themes

Within CANW, we are currently developing several thematic explorations:

* 📘 **Jomon Fiction**

  * Reconstructing the Jomon world through AI-generated storytelling, landscape thinking, and network analysis.

* ⛩ **Shrine Fiction**

  * Creating myth-inspired fiction based on shrine distribution and watershed networks.

* 🦠 **Tobimushi Manga**

  * A sci-fi manga set in the soil ecology and mycorrhizal networks, born from collaborative loops between AI and human creators.

---

## 🤖 Tools and Technologies

We currently leverage the following tools and OSS technologies:

* **ChatGPT / GPT-4**: Scenario drafting, idea expansion, translation assistance
* **DALL·E / Midjourney**: Visual generation for characters, environments, and key scenes
* **Python + Pillow / Mermaid**: Automating diagram generation and speech bubble layouts
* **Next.js / React**: Frontend implementation for visual storytelling

## 🌱 Join the Loop

AI Collaboration is an open framework welcoming contributions from both coders and non-coders alike.
**Conceptualization, research, writing, design, visualization, and dissemination** — participation is welcome from any layer!

It’s not just about generating.
It’s about questioning, reweaving, and co-creating as a living network.
Welcome to the “AI Story.”
